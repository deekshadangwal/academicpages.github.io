I'm a third year Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science department at UC Santa Barbara. I work in in the ArchLab with Prof. Tim Sherwood, in computer architecture, and I am interested in understanding and characterizing program behavior through novel and efficient profiling methods -- by measuring and tracking information flow through systems. Currently, I am exploring privacy in program traces via a synthetic trace generation technique with the intent of minimizing information leakage to promote safe program behavior sharing (to appear in ASPLOS 2019). Previously, I have worked on PyRTL (https://github.com/UCSBarchlab/PyRTL), a Python-based RTL specification language, and built an AES-128 core and the OpenTPU (https://github.com/UCSBarchlab/OpenTPU) on it. I have also worked on Charm (https://github.com/UCSBarchlab/Charm), a high-level architecture modeling language.
