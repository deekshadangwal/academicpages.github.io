I'm a third year Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science department at UC Santa Barbara. I work in in the [ArchLab](https://www.arch.cs.ucsb.edu/) with [Prof. Tim Sherwood](https://cs.ucsb.edu/~sherwood), in computer architecture. I am interested in understanding the system security in the context of program behavior, and I do this by measuring and tracking information flow through systems. 

Currently, I am exploring privacy in program traces via a synthetic trace generation technique, called trace wringing. Trace wringing tries to minimize information leakage and promotes safe program behavior sharing (ASPLOS 2019). 

Previously, I have worked on [PyRTL](https://github.com/UCSBarchlab/PyRTL), a Python-based RTL specification language, and built an AES-128 core and the [OpenTPU](https://github.com/UCSBarchlab/OpenTPU) on it. I have also worked on [Charm](https://github.com/UCSBarchlab/Charm), a high-level architecture modeling language.
